Description:
    HMP16SData is a Bioconductor ExperimentData package of the Human Microbiome
    Project (HMP) 16S rRNA sequencing data for variable regions 1–3 and 3–5. Raw
    data files are provided in the package as downloaded from the HMP Data
    Analysis and Coordination Center. Processed data is provided as
    SummarizedExperiment class objects via ExperimentHub.
