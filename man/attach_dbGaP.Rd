from the \code{\link{HMP16SData}} package}

\item{dbGaP_repository_key}{A repository key downloaded from dbGaP; only
required for the initial download and not needed thereafter}

\description{
The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database of
Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) has extensive metadata pretaining to the HMP
study. Access to this data is controlled and its use requires authorization
by the appropriate Data Access Committee â€“ further information is available
\href{https://tinyurl.com/yb7okvga}{here}. Those with authorization will be
able to download a dbGaP repository key and can use it to attach the
controlled-access metadata to a
\code{\link[SummarizedExperiment]{SummarizedExperiment}} object with a single
command, provided the NCBI SRA Toolkit is installed and on your \code{PATH}.
See note below for further information.
}
\note{
The NCBI SRA Toolkit is called internally and must be on your \code{PATH} or
an error message will be displayed. The NCBI SRA Toolkit can be readily
installed on multiple platforms following
\href{https://tinyurl.com/y845ppaa}{these} instructions or by one of the
following methods.
